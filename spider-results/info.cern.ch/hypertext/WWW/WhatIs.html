<h1>What is HyperText</h1>Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.<p>
Hypertext is text which contains <a name="0" href="Terms.html#link">links</a> to other texts. The term was
coined by <a name="1" href="Xanadu.html#Nelson">Ted Nelson</a> around 1965 (see <a name="12" href="../History.html">History</a> ).</p><p>
HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to
be text: it can include graphics, video and <a name="9" href="Talks/YesWeCan.snd/index.html">sound</a> , for example. Apparently
Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.</p><p>
Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.</p><p>
