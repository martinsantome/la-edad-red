<h1>Installing WWW</h1>This section describes how to install
the World-Wide Web<a name="1" href="QuickGuide.html"> line-mode browser</a>
called "www". First of all,
<ul>
<li>If you have a VAX/VMS machine, then
see the <a name="4" href="Installation_VMS.html">special instuctions for VMS</a>

</li><li>If you have not already got hold
of the files, see the section on<a name="5" href="Distribution.html">
getting them</a> .
</li><li>If you have a VM mainframe, see <a name="z16" href="../vm-cms/Overview.html">special
instructions</a>.
</li></ul>The browser has already been ported
to many machines. Check the list
of <a name="14" href="MachineTypes.html">machine types</a> for your machine.
If your machine is not one of those,
see the section on <a name="7" href="Porting.html">porting</a> .
<h2>If the binary is available</h2>If you found your machine type, check
in the anonymous FTP archive for
the subdirectory of /pub/www/bin
for your machine. If that directory
exists and contains a file named
www with some version number appended,
then select binary mode and take
the file, calling your copy www.
Otherwise, go to >a href=#Compiling>"compiling
from source" .
<ul>
<li>Copy www into an apropriate directory
which appears in your path. If you
can be superuser, this can be /usr/local/bin/www
(typically) so that everyone can
use www. If you cannot be superuser,
see <a name="12" href="InstallNotSU.html">how to use ww without being superuser</a>
).
</li><li>If you type "rehash", you will be
able to use www. It will start at
a default home page which is at CERN.

</li><li>To make your own home page, take
the tar file WWWLineModeDefaults.tar.Z.
Unwrap it and put the files into
a directory /usr/local/lib/WWW. Now
skip to <a name="15" href="#Home">make yourself at home</a> below.
</li></ul>
<h2><a name="Compiling">Compiling from source</a></h2>If a binary is not available, get
the sources.
<ul>
<li>You must get, uncompress and untar
BOTH the WWWLineMode* product AND
the WWWLibrary* product source tar
files.
</li><li>Find the subdirectory of WWW/LineMode
named after your machine type. cd
to it.
</li><li>Check the directory definitions in
the Makefile, and change them if
necessary. See the definition of
the macros in the file<a name="6" href="../Implementation/CommonMakefile/index.html"> Implementation/CommonMakefile</a>
.
</li><li>Type "make lib". You should get a
file WWW/Library/libwww.a
</li><li>Type "make". You should get a binary
of WWW/LineMode/www.
</li></ul>
<h2><a name="8">Installing</a>
<ul>
<li>Become superuser (su root).  If you
can't do this, see<a name="12" href="InstallNotSU.html"> how to do it without
being superuser</a> ).
</li><li>Type "make install". A reference
copy of the executable is made and
copied into the system.
</li></ul>The "make install" step creates a
copy in your system directories of
the www executable and the basic
documenattion. If you wish to just
soft link them to the files on the
WWW tree, say "make link" instead.
After either of these, "make clean"
will remove intermediate files.
<h2><a name="Home">Make yourself at home</a></h2>You must now check that the default
"Home" page works, and<a name="13" href="Customisation.html"> customize
it</a> if it is not what you want. The
default home page just a place to
start. The cern.html file (distributed
at the same time) is an example of
a customized home page. You may wish
to chose one of these as a basis.
<h2>Setting up news</h2>To read Internet news, you must have
first defined the<a name="11" href="NewsServer.html"> news server's address</a>
.
