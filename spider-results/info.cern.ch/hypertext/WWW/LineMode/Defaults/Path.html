<title>Path -- /Defaults</title>
<nextid 2="">
<h1>Unix "path"</h1>This is the set of directories which the system looks in for executable
files.  You can find out what your path is by the command
<xmp>			echo $path

</xmp>Normally the path is set by a command in your <a name="1" href="LoginScript.html">login shell script</a> .
Remember that if you change your path, then you must type
<xmp>			rehash

</xmp>so that the shell rebuilds the set of executable files which it will
accept as commands.
