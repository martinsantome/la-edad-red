<h1>Recompiling  for VMS</h1>This is how to get the sources for <a name="3" href="QuickGuide.html">www</a> and recompile them.  You need
to do this if you have a shareable library incompatibility with the
distributed executable. The tar file is, on info.cern.ch, /pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z,
 v.vv being the version - get the latest.  If you are on the HEP DECnet,
then the files can be found under
<xmp>			vxcrna::disk$oc1:[timbl.www.*]

<h2><a name="1">Changing to a new TCP/IP version</a></h2>Do this bit if your TCP/IP system is not  SRI/Multinet, DEC/UCX or
whatever they call it now, or Wollongong TCP/IP.<p>
You might need to change something in tcp.h which is the system specific
include file, and in descrip.mms, the makefile. If you do, please
mail me the changes.</p><p>
Look for all occurences of "MULTINET", "UCX" or "WIN_TCP" and add
a "CMU_TEK" or whatever where necessary.  The same goes for decsrip.mms.
This will need to pass the CMU_TEK option onto the c compiler in the
CFLAGS macro, and also use different libraries for the link. Changes
to other files will probably not be necessary.</p><p>
[The program uses the socket library in a very standard way - no tricks.
You just have to get the include files from the right place and fix
the macros for NETREAD etc to whatever CMU-TEK calls the socket read()
function. It can't call it read() because that's in the VMS unix library
already for file access. You notice that under some systems the read
does a socket_read or a real read depending on whether the socket
number is small (unix) or large (VMS channel=socket).  I don't know
what CMU-TEK does but I'm interested to know  If you don't know either,
try compiling for say WIN_TCP and see what's undefined and mail me]</p><p>
If you do this, let me know how you get on, please!
</p><h2><a name="2">Compiling</a></h2>One way, if you have a unix (sultrix?) system with DECnet is to unwrap
the tar file on that system.<p>
Then copy WWW/LineMode/Implementation/vms/descrip.mms across to VMS.
Edit descrip.mms so that all the references to $(U)"/userd/tbl/hypertext
are changed to point to the decnet address of the files you have unwrapped
on the unix system. Then run mms with /macro=(u=HOST::, cmu_tek=1)
-- whatever your unix HOST is -- and it will pickup all the files
from your unix system.</p><p>
The other way is to uncompress/untar it on under VMS, if you have
a tool to do that, and just run mms/macro=(cmu_tek=1).
