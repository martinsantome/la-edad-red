<title>Shortcuts -- /LineMode</title>
<nextid 6="">
<h1>Shortcuts</h1>To save having always to go through the <a name="1" href="QuickGuide.html">www</a> default page, you can
use a shortcut to get to an index. On the central CERN nodes for example,
the following shell commands are predefined:
<dl>
<dt>yellow
<dd> The CERN yellow pages telephone directory.
<dt>xfind
<dd> The CERN computer center documentation keyword index
<dt>vmnews
<dd> The CERN computer centre news service: all news articles, in
reverse chronological order.
</dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dl>
You can search an index which has a shortcut command by giving the
keywords as parameters, e.g.
<xmp>
			yellow taxes


</xmp>To make your own shortcuts, you can define your own commands. On Unix
(with csh), use an alias (see <a name="2" href="VMS_Shortcuts.html">VMS equivalent</a> ) :
<xmp>
			alias  z  www  address

</xmp>where address is the hypertext address of the document you want to
jump into. You can find the hypertext address of a node from <a name="5" href="Commands.html#8">HELP</a><a name="3" href="Commands.html#2">
</a>command when you are in www.<p>
An alternative method uses a shell script.
