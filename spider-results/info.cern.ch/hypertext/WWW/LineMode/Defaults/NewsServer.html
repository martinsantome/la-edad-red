<title>NewsServer -- /Defaults</title>
<nextid 1="">
<h1>News Server address</h1>To be able to read news, the www program needs the address of a news
server. This is a machine which runs the NNTP protocol.  If you already
use internet news on your site, you will have one of these. There
are several ways you can tell www which news server to use.<p>
Note you may also have your machine enabled as being authorised to
pick up news from the news server by that server's system manager.
</p><h2>Exception</h2>
<dl>
<dt>On a NeXT
<dd> The NeXT defaults are read, looking for a value for "NewsHost"
for application name "WorldWideWeb", then for a global default, then
for application named "News". 
</dd></dt></dl>

<h2>All other cases</h2>
<h3>Set an environment variable</h3>You can set the environment variable NNTPSERVER to be the internet
address of the server. You can do this in your .login file. (On VMS,
use a logical name, on  VM/CMS, the CENV globalv table).
<h3>Use a file</h3>The file /usr/local/lib/rn/server will be read if it exists and no
environment variable is defined.  It should contain the single line
containing the name of the news server.  This filename may be overridden
at compile time by defining the SERVER_FILE symbol to be the quoted
string.
<h3>At compile time</h3>If you are installing www for several people, you can set the default
by defining the variable DEFAULT_NEWS_HOST to be the quoted string
of the server name on the command line fo the compilation of the HTNews.c
module  For example, use the option (check your own compiler's command
line syntax)
<xmp>
			-DDEFAULT_NEWS_HOST="mynewshost.domain"

</xmp>
<h3>Use a domain name alias</h3>If  no other deafult news host is found, the software looks for a
machine with name or alias "news" in the local domain. If your domain
has a single news server which you would like to use as a default,
and the person in charge of the domain name registration agrees, then
make an alias "news" for the server. This will have the managemnt
advantage that the administration can move the news server without
any trouble later.  (This is the way it is done at CERN).
