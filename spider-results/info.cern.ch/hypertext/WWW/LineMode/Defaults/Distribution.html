<h1>Getting the WWW files</h1>Read this if you have not yet got the WWW files you need, and you
cannot NFS mount a directory on which they reside.<p>
 The source and binary of WWW project files are currently available
(see <a name="1" href="../../../Copyright.html">copyright</a> ) by anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch.  This node
is currently 128.141.201.74 but THIS MAY CHANGE. The files are compressed
tape archive files (.tar.Z).  To get  a file using anonymous FTP,
use user name "anonymous", and your email address as a password:-
<xmp>			> ftp info.cern.ch
			Enter user name: anonymous
			Password: me@myhost.edu
			ftp> cd /pub/www/src
			ftp> binary
			ftp> get WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z
			ftp> quit
			>

</xmp>The file name will depend on the product you want.  Here vvv is the
version number of the software.</p><p>
Once you have the compressed tar file, you must uncompress it and
unwrap it.
<xmp>			uncompress WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z

</xmp>This will make a rather larger file with the name without the ".Z".
To unwrap it,
<xmp>			tar xvf WWWLineMode_vvv.tar

</xmp>Now you should <a name="2" href="Installation.html">install the line mode browser</a> , <a name="3" href="../../Daemon/User/Guide.html">install the server</a>
,<a name="4" href="../../../Viola/Installation.html"> install Viola</a> , etc.
