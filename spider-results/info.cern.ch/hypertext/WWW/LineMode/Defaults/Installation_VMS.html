<h1>Installation under VMS</h1>To install under VMS, get the files WWW.EXE and SETUP.COM from sources
described below. To set up the commands, put the command
<xmp>			$ @[...]SETUP

</xmp>into your LOGIN.COM, or the system SYLOGIN.COM.  This command file
assumes you have left all the distributed files  in the same directory
as itself.
<h2><a name="3">Customization using logical names</a></h2>Under VMS,  the home page may be defined using the logical name WWW_HOME.
You should define this to be the full address of the document which
you want to be displayed when www is invoked without parameters. For
example,
<xmp>        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM WWW_HOME "file://myvax/sys$library/default.html"

</xmp>Note that the www address you must set it to is still in unix-like
format (with slashes instead of :: : [.])Users may of course override
the system logical name with their own. If no logical name is defined,
the VMS browser will default to picking up the default page from our
server,  document http://info.cern.ch./default.html.<p>
The other <a name="4" href="Customisation.html">customization variables</a> may be defined in the same way.</p><p>
Accessing VMS files</p><p>
If you are making you own home page, or any other documentation, you
will probably want to store it on your VMS machine. The www program
has the ability, if running under VMS,  to access VMS files. the document
name for a VMS file is simply the filename, but:</p><p>
The host name must be the name of the machine WITHOUT any domain name
on it, e.g. //vxcrna/</p><p>
The filename is written with each punctuation converted into a single
slash. Examples are
<xmp> Document identifier           			Filename

 file://vxcrna/sys$www_home			vxcrna::sys$home

</xmp>
</p><h2><a name="1">Availability of .EXE files</a></h2>Versions are available for any of the following implementations of
TCP/IP which you may have installed on your system: Digital's UCX,
Wollongongs's WIN/TCP, or SRI's Multinet.  If you are on the High
Energy Physics DECnet, the versions are currently (Jan 92) available
compiled in directories as follows:
<dl>
<dt>Wollongong WIN_TCP
<dd> none - see <a name="6" href="Installation_VMS_NewTCP.html#2">recompiling</a> .
<dt>Multinet
<dd> vxcrna::disk$oc1:[timbl.www.multinet.works]
<dt>Digital's UCX
<dd> vxcrna::disk$oc1:[timbl.www.ucx.works]
<dt>CMU TCP
<dd> none - see r<a name="5" href="Installation_VMS_NewTCP.html#1"> ecompiling</a> .
</dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dl>
If you are not on HEPnet, but can pick up binary files from info.cern.ch
using FTP,  then you will find executables in the /pub/www/bin/vms,
as files www_ucx.exe or www_multinet.exe. Remember to transfer in
binary mode. Pick one and rename it to www.exe
<h2>Rebuilding from source</h2>You may have to do this if your sharable libraries are not compatible
with those for which the .EXE file was built. If there is a version
incompatability, then you get an explicit message about sharable library
versions when you try to run www.<p>
If you have utilities for uncompressing and untarring the main source
file, then you could remake the distribution from source.</p><p>
Another way of getting the sources up can be used if you happen to
have access to an untrix machine on the same DECnet as your vax. FTP
the source tar file over to the ultrix machine, uncompress it and
untar it, then copy over the descrip.mms in LineMode/Implementation/vms.
In there you'll find all the commands to copy the sources from a unix
machine (PRIAM:: in that instance -- you'll have to edit it) and rebuild
the .exe. </p><p>
When you remake the exe, you must specifify
<xmp>
			MMS/MACRO=(MULTINET=1)
		or

			MMS/MACRO=(WIN_TCP=1)
		or

			MMS/MACRO=(UCX=1)

</xmp>to get the right version for Multinet, Wollongong TCP or DEC/UCX respectively.
