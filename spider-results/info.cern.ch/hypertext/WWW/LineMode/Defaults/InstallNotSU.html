<h1>Installing www if you are not superuser</h1>So you want to install www, but you do not have the privilege to become
super-user.   No problem: you can install it for your own use.<p>
You have found (or <a name="1" href="Porting.html">built if it did not exist</a> ) a subdirectory of WWW/LineMode/Implementation
for your type of machine.</p><p>
You have modified the Makefile in that directory to reflect the directory
name. Don't worry about BINDIR, the name of the installation directory,
because you aren't making a system-wide installation.</p><p>
Type
<xmp>			make


</xmp>This should generate the executable file called "www". There are two
ways you can make this available. </p><p>
One is, if in your "<a name="2" href="Path.html"> path</a> " there is a directory to wrich you do have
write access, then you put move www into that directory. You may have
to then "rehash" to regenerate the list of commands.</p><p>
If there isn't a writable directory on your path, then you can put
an alias command into a login shell script (.login or .cshrc) to define
www as being a file in the directory where it is.</p><p>
Now if you run www it will complain that it can't find the default
home page, /usr/local/bin/WWW/default.html.  You will find a copy
of a default page in the distribution WWW/LineMode/Defaults/default.html.</p><p>
In your <a name="3" href="LoginScript.html">login shell script</a> ,  set the environment variable WWW_HOME
to  the full pathname of default.html as distributed, or to the w3
address of the copy on our server. See <a name="4" href="Customisation.html">customization</a> about how to
set environment variables.
