<title>Installing the line mode WWW browser on VM</title>

<h1>Installing www on VM</h1>This is possible, and has been done
at CERN and Rutherford labs, for
example.  However, the latest version
has probably not been done. Because
no two VM systems seem to be the
same, you may have to change things
in order to find things like libraries
and standard C header files.<p>
Here are some files which were used
during the last port to VM.   The
C and H files are all the same as
the unix distribution: take the LineMode
and Library tar files.</p><p>
(If you are at or connected to CERNVM
you can of course pick up the WWW
EXEC and WWW MODULE from the public
disks there.)</p><p>
Note that compiling with (DEF(VM,IBM,DEBUG,SHORT_NAMES))
selects the code options for VM,
in particular  replaces long identifiers
which are ambiguous when truncated
with short identifiers.  Do not worry
about warnings about truncated identifiers,
only worry about errors when two
different identifiers are truncated
to the same thing.

now got the WWW line mode browser
going on VM. All it needed were a
couple of extra options on the CMOD
command of MAKEW, the AMODE and RMODE
options allow XA mode to work. The
RLDSAVE makes the module relocatable
(at the cost of increased size),
allowing users to run the module
who have machines configured differently
from the machine that built it.
