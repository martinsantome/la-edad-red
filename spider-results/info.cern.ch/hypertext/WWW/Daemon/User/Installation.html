<h1>Installing te basic httop daemon</h1>The usual way to install a daemon is to either run it from the bootstrap
command file (for example /etc/rc) so that it runs continuously, or
to set up the internet daemon (inetd) to run it when a call comes
in. <p>
Remember to make a <a name="5" href="RuleFile.html">rule file</a> unless you explicitly supress it with
the -R option.
</p><h2><a name="2">Using the Internet daemon</a></h2>There is a csh script to do this for a BSD unix system. You might
want to edit it to run on other systems. <p>
Otherwise, just follow the <a name="9" href="Inetd.html">instructions for installing a server under
the internet daemon</a>.
</p><h2>Log file</h2>If  a log file is required,  make sure that the user name under which
the daemon is run  has the right to write the file
