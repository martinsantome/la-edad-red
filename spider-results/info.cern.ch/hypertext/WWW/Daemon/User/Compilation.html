<h1>Compiling httpd</h1>The <a name="5" href="Guide.html">daemon</a> files come in a tar file, which you should uncompress and
unwrap.   There are also binaries available for some architecures:
if you have one, already, skip to <a name="6" href="Installation.html">installation</a>.<p>
In the WWW/Daemon/Implementation directory created are several subdirectories,
for each machine architecture.  Each has a Makefile. If your machine
type (eg sun4, NeXT) is not there, copy one that is and its Makefile.</p><p>
Edit the Makefile to set up particular paths you use on your system.</p><p>
Type make httpd</p><p>
Go on to <a name="4" href="Installation.html">install the deamon</a> under the inetd or in /etc/rc to run continuously.</p><p>
