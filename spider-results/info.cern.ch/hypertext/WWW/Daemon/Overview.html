<h1>W3 Server Software</h1>A <a name="23" href="../TheProject.html">W3</a> server, like the ftp <a name="19" href="../Terms.html#daemon">daemon</a> , is a program which responds to
an incoming tcp connection and provides a service to the caller.There
are many varieties of W3 server software to serve different forms
of data. 
<h2>The basic daemon</h2>The basic W3  daemon program serves files already in hypertext or
plain text.  This daemon then is used as a basis for many other types
of server and gateway.    Documentation includes:
<ul>
<li><a name="1" href="User/Guide.html">User guide</a> . 
</li><li><a name="18" href="Basic.html">Internals</a> -- a description of the code.
</li></ul>Much of the above may also apply in whole or part to other servers
mentioned below.  Whatever server you are running, you will probably
be interested in:

</li></ul>
<h2>Making a new server</h2>This daemon is often used as a basis for a more specific server for
a given application.  A server which allows a world of data to be
seen as part of the W3 universe is known as a gateway.  (Most servers
could therefore be regarded as gateways, but the term implies some
conversion or mapping between dissimilar worlds) .  For  short tutorials
with examples, see:

<li><a name="15" href="JanetAndJohn.html">Writing a server in C</a>
</li><li><a name="22" href="../Provider/ShellScript.html">Writing a server as a script</a>
</li></ul>It is a good idea to pick the basic daemon or one of the servers below
as a starting point when making a new server.
<h2><a name="20">Other servers and Gateways</a></h2>These are servers which provide data extracted from other systems.
they are built using code from the basic daemon, or scripts.
