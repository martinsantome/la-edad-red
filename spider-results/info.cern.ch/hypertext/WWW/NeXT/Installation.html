<title>Installing WorldWideWeb on the NeXT</title>
<nextid 16="">
<h1>Installation</h1>To install the <a name="0" href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a> program properly you will need to be superuser.
It is possible to use take a private copy of the program<a name="1" href="#private"> (see below)</a>
if you really have to, but for a system-wide copy, the steps are as
follows. If you are at CERN, you should use NFS to remotely mount
the files (see <a name="7" href="UsingNFS.html">explanation</a> ).  REMEMBER THE dwrite you need<a name="15" href="#14"> below</a>.
<ul>
<li>Make a suitable directory to hold the release. cd to that directory.
</li><li>Get the tar file using <a name="13" href="../LineMode/Defaults/Distribution.html">anonymous FTP</a> .
</li><li>Take the .tar file using ftp or whatever (see <a name="12" href="../../README.html">distribution</a> ) and unwrap
it using tar .
</li><li>Become superuser
</li><li><a name="4">Make a soft link from your LocalApps directory to the file WorldWideWeb
itself</a> .
</li></ul>The commands to do this are therefore (inserting the full path name
of your directory where indicated, and the version number for vvv):-
<xmp>		tar -xf WWWNeXTStepEditor_vvv.tar
		su root
		mkdir /LocalApps
		ln -s /(fullpathname)/WorldWideWeb.app /LocalApps

</xmp>Don't do the mkdir step if you already have a /LocalApps directory
<h3><a name="private">Making a private copy</a></h3>If you don't have privilege, and you don't have the ear of someone
who does, it is possible to take a private copy of the program. It
is better, of course, to get it installed system-wide, but if desperate,
procede as above but instead link the application to your own directory,
and take a copy of the system default file as your own default file.
The commands are therefore:-
<xmp>		tar -xf WWWMeXTStepEditor_vvv.tar
		ln -s /(fullpathname)/WorldWideWeb ~/Apps
</xmp>
<h3><a name="6">Personal setup</a></h3>Each person who wants to use it on the machine, whether it is a system
copy or his private copy, must before he can use WWW:
<ul>
<li>Set his default NewsHost (can this be done system-wide?) to be the
name of a server running the NNTP protocol. If he is already using
"News" this will be unnecessary, as WWW will use News's default. (At
CERN only, at the time of writing, a suitable news host was cernvax.cern.ch.)
The <a name="14">shell command</a> is
</li></ul>
<xmp>       		dwrite WorldWideWeb NewsHost (hostname)

</xmp>You (each user) may later want to create your own WWW subdirectory
under your home directory. In that subdirectory you may like to put
:
<ul>
<li>A personal hypertext home page. This is a file default.html which
will be displayed whenever the application is started. Create it by
starting WWW to load the system default home page,  editing it, then
using the "<a name="11" href="Menus.html#21"> Save a copy in..HTML..</a> " item in the Window menu, and
selecting your private WWW subdirectory.
</li><li>A personal blank note. This is a file blank.html which will be used
as a template whenever you create a new hypertext file with the "<a name="9" href="Menus.html#22">
New file</a> " or "<a name="10" href="Menus.html#16"> Link to new</a> " commands. Create it  by using the "<a name="8" href="Menus.html#22">
New file</a> " item in the "Window" menu and selecting your personal $(HOME)/WWW/blank.html
as filename.
</li><li>A default <a name="2" href="Styles.html">style sheet</a> .</li></ul></nextid>
